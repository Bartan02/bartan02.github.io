# BARTOSZ ADAMCZYK
__Welcome to my portfolio website repository!__ This project showcases my web development skills and serves as a collection of my work, featuring various projects and experiments with modern web technologies.

## üñ•Ô∏è Technologies Used

The website is built using a range of front-end and back-end technologies:

- **Next.js:** The primary React-based framework for server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and hybrid applications.
- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used to create a seamless, component-based architecture.
- **TypeScript:** Superset of JavaScript for type safety and better developer experience.
- **Tailwind CSS:** CSS preprocessor for better styling organization and maintainability.

The following libraries/frameworks were implemented on this portfolio website to enrich it:

- **i18next:** internationalization framework that enables multi-language support in the portfolio.
- **animate.css:** CSS animation library that provides pre-defined animations to bring elements to life.
- **react-animate-on-scroll:** React wrapper for animate.css, allowing elements to animate when they appear in the viewport.
- **tailwindcss-motion:** extends Tailwind CSS with utility classes for motion and transitions.
